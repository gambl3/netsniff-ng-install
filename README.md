install-scripts
===============

Forked copy of various scripts for installing or configuring select netsniff-ng software. Attempting to complete install for CentOS 6.7. Thus far can acheive success for all tools except trafgen. CentOS 6.7 doesn't seem to want to play nice due to lack of tpacket_v3 support.
